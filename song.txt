She is just a lonely girl
Who thinks it's all real
No lies in my eyes
Distrust that I killed

OOOOU Follow Me
I'll show you how to feel
I'll show you how to die and live
How it really shoud be

She is just a lonely girl
Who once lost her mind
I will go with you to find
The shining in the night
OOOOU Follow Me
Tell me who you want to be
I will show you the truth in the lie
How it really shoud be
